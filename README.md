# VIM - Honeydew colorscheme

Made this colorscheme because honeydew is my favorite fruit and I just wanted to give it a shot.

If you would like to use it, in your terminal, do a
`git clone https://github.com/jorgediazjr/vim_colorscheme_honeydew.git`
and then copy the `honeydew.vim` file to your `~/.vim/colors/` directory.

Then go to your `~/.vimrc` file and add the following line wherever on your file, `colorscheme honeydew`.
